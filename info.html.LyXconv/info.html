Limbo is the closet in Purgatory, the area between Hell and Heaven alleys in Blacker House. This closet houses an &ldquo;honor-code store&rdquo;, an exchange where moles and social-moles may buy and sell things (mostly drinks and snacks). Things work on the honor code, which means that nobody should take advantage of anyone else. This obviously means that theft of items or money is not allowed. What this also implies is that buyers should live up to their promise to pay for things they buy. While we don’t require buyers to pay immediately, we do require them to record their purchases and act in their best capacity to avoid being in debt.
